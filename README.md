# MinePy Updater
(Name is WIP. Open to suggestions.)

This project is my attempt at making the process of updating Minecraft modpacks significantly less tedious. It is purely for updating mods at this point. It is not supposed to replace launchers (...yet), but rather complement them. It currently relies on the [Twitch Apiary API](https://twitchappapi.docs.apiary.io/) for mod identifying and updating. However, with [Overwolf taking over CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/data-transfer-information) this *probably* won't remain the case in the future. Hopefully, Overwolf will provide their own (again *hopefully*) public API.
