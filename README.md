# MinePy Updater
(Name WIP, open to suggestions)

This project is my attempt at making the process of updating Minecraft mods less tedious and lightweight. This is purely for updating mods at this point. It is not supposed to replace launchers (...yet), like MultiMC, but rather complement them. This currently relies on the [Twitch Apiary API](https://twitchappapi.docs.apiary.io/). However, with Overwolf taking over CurseForge this *probably* won't remain the case in the future.
